 * The buffers are written to the flash in a ring buffer. Even after being
 * posted to the server they remain until overwritten. This supports a recovery
 * option in case of loss at the server, and other options for local access.
 *
 * In operation the code only needs to know the head and tail of the flash
 * sector ring. At start-up it needs to be able to find this position as
 * reliably as possible. A 32 bit monotonically increasing index is used to
 * allow this point to be found. This index is not expected to wrap in practical
 * usage which avoids handling wrapping of this index. To protect this index
 * against interrupted writes and bad sectors it is written twice, the second
 * time with each bit inverted. This index is located in the first 8 bytes of
 * each flash sector. This index increases for each complete sector successfully
 * written, and if a write fails then it is retried at the next sector using the
 * same index. A server receiving two sectors with the same index would use the
 * most recent sector and would need to deal with the complexity of sector
 * number wrapping, but the node attempts to invalidate a bad sector written so
 * it might never be sent to the server.
 *
 * The sectors do not have a length encoding, rather the entire sector is always
 * posted to the server. Unused bytes are filled with ones, so the node might
 * omit trailing ones when sending a sector.
 *
 * A new sector is started each time the node restarts, but to minimize
 * unnecessary writes of unused sectors a sector is not initialized until used.
